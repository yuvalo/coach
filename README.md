Motivational tooltips for when you are testing an application in the browser.

I got a little* bored while debugging a web app and needed some motivation and this came out. 
The script will display random motivational tooltips at random points of time. Use it to remind yourself to take a break, or just remember how awesome you really are. 

Include these files and add this div to anywhere you want to on your page:
<div id="motivate"></div>
